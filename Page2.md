# What is an SVG?
### **SVG** stands for *Scalable Vector Graphic*s
SVGs are a type of Vector graphic used for rendering two-dimensional images on the internet.

**What is the main difference between SVGs (and Vector graphics in general) and the usual Bitmap Graphic?**
Resolution and quality upon image scaling.
**Bitmap Graphics** are displayed using pixels, and depending on the number of pixels,
the image will be higher or lower quality. The more pixels the graphic has, the higher
the quality. This is the most common graphic format, and likely the format you'd imagine
when thinking of a digital image.

**SVGs** are displayed using a different approach, as are all Vector Graphics. Instead of being a mapped out set of
pixels, SVGs use mathematical equations. Essentially, this means that the lines/shapes 
that make up the graphic are placed based on calculations relative to each other.

**What this means:**
A regular bitmapped graphic, since it is made up of a number of pixels, will lose quality
as it is scaled larger.
*An SVG*, however, will **not** lose quality upon scaling. This is because it creates the
graphic based on calculations, *not* pixels.
