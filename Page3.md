# Applications of SVGs:
## When are SVGs useful?
---
Because of they are infinitly scalable without loss of visual quality, SVGs are most useful when your graphic is going to be used for multiple purposes.

For example, SVGs are commonly used for company logos. 

A company logo can be seen in many places, including but not limited to:
-Company websites
-Online Advertisements
-Owned content (like a video)

---
With all these possible applications, the logo would need to be adjusted to a scale that matches. It would be far less effiecient to create a new version of the logo graphic for every application to prevent bad quality.
### This is why SVGs are so useful- you can reuse the same image at any scale without an issue with quality!
