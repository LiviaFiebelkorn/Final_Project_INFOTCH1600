# How to Create Your Own SVG!
##**Part 2:** Using HTML
In this part of the tutorial, we will go over the basic HTML set up!

What is HTML? *HTML is the standard web page markup language.*

It is helpful to already have previous knowledge on HTML for this tutorial, however not necessary.

**Step 1:** Defining the doctype as HTML.

*Print this into your text editor:*
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  ```
**Step 2:** Inserting the body. (This is where the SVG code will be kept!)
  
*Print this into your text editor*:
  ```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  ```
**Step 3:** Inserting a header (optional).
 *You can call this whatever you'd like! For this example, I will be calling this "My New SVG". Print this:*
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My new SVG</h1>
  ```
**Step 4:** Final touches.
It is important to close each part of the code when you are done with it. To do this, you simply add a backslash.
*Print this:*
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  
<h1>My new SVG</h1>
  
</body>
</html>
  ```
